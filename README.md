# Candidate Survey Platform
A tool/platform for community groups to more efficiently and effectively survey candidates in elections.

We’re just in the early research, planning, and design phase.

The hope, right now, is to have a collectively usable tool/platform for community groups to survey candidates on issues in the 2017 Calgary municipal election. We’re targetting spring 2017 to have the first version up and ready to use by community groups.

This project is not intended just for that one election or community, though — we’re just using that as a starting point.

See the [project wiki](https://github.com/grantneufeld/candidatesurvey/projects) for the documentation we’re compiling on project ideas, the needs of both the surveying community groups and the surveyed candidates, and research related to the project.

See the [project issues](https://github.com/grantneufeld/candidatesurvey/issues) on GitHub for implementation suggestions.
